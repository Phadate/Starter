# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow Learning Notes

## Production-ready Python frameworks

- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras (CNTK)

### Roadmap

- What Machine Learning is, what problems it tries to solve, and the main categories and fundamental concepts of its systems

- The steps in a typical Machine Learing project

- Learning by fitting a model to data

- Optimizing a cost function

- Handling, cleaning, and preparing data

- Selecting and engineering features

- Selecting a model and turning hyperparameters using cross-validation

- The challenges of Machine Learning, in particular underfitting and overfitting (the bias/variance trade-off)

- The most common learning algorithms: Linear and polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vectors Mschines, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Ensemble methods

- Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the "curse of dimensionality"

- Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection

### What is Machine Learning?

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance onT, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  - Tom, Mitchell,1997

### Why use Machine Learning?

It helps to distuguish between the traditional way of programming to the machine Learning approach
In summary, Machine learning is great for

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine learning algorithm can ofthrn simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach

- Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine Learning techinques can perhaps find a solution

- Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.

- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
